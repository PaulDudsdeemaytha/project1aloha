#Project 1 README

When first glancing over the Aloha Project, my initial thought was that the website was going to be quite quick and easy to construct. I soon learned that I was in for an adventure I have not yet prepared myself properly for... 

Constructing the HTML skeleton was a good refresher for me, however when starting the CSS was when the learning curve came in. The website had small details that required alot of attention in the css file. The amount of detail to watch out for became even more prevelent when starting RWD. I definetely felt that if I started mobilefirst, my code would be easier to manage. Something to note for next time. 

All in all, after finishing up the Aloha project, I look back at my code and although it works, I know in the future I can make the code alot cleaner than it is currently. I put alot of unneccesary code and I feel as though thats the most important thing I learned during this project, being more efficient.
